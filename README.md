TRS Alliance v2.3: GhostShift-Powered Platform
Welcome to TRS Alliance, a cutting-edge, simulation-ready platform designed for operators to enable secure, scalable, and high-performance mission-critical applications. Powered by GhostShift, TRS Alliance provides robust user action logging, verification, and real-time data visualization for operational excellence.
Overview
TRS Alliance is built with modern web technologies to deliver a seamless experience for operators managing complex workflows. The platform integrates Next.js for server-side rendering, TypeScript for type safety, TailwindCSS for responsive styling, and Firebase for secure data management and authentication. Deployed on Netlify, it leverages serverless functions and optimized asset caching for performance.
Key Features

GhostShift Integration: Enables secure, simulation-driven workflows for operators.
Real-Time Visualizations: Interactive dashboards with charts (e.g., ROI, cost savings) using Recharts.
Secure Logging: Tracks and verifies user actions with Firebase-backed authentication.
Scalable Architecture: Deployed via Netlify with CI/CD pipelines for rapid iteration.
Responsive Design: TailwindCSS ensures accessibility across devices.

Getting Started
Prerequisites

Node.js: Version 20 (as specified in netlify.toml)
npm: For package management
Firebase Account: For authentication and data storage
Netlify CLI: For local development and deployment

Installation

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/TRSAlliance/.github.git
cd .github


Install Dependencies:
npm install --legacy-peer-deps


Configure Environment:Create a .env.local file based on .env.local.example and add your Firebase and API keys:
VITE_API_BASE=https://api.trs-alliance.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your-api-key


Run Locally:
npm run dev

Open http://localhost:3000 to view the app.

Build for Production:
npm run build



Deployment
The project is configured for Netlify deployment via netlify.toml:

Build Command: npm run build
Publish Directory: dist
Functions: Serverless functions in netlify/functions (e.g., fetch-roi.js for dynamic data)
Environment: Node 20, with VITE_API_BASE for API calls
Redirects: SPA routing with /* to /index.html
Caching: Assets cached for 1 year (/assets/*)

Deploy to Netlify:
netlify deploy --prod

Example Usage
The dashboard (dashboard.tsx) includes interactive visualizations for:

Problem Analysis: Pie chart showing cost, inefficiency, and audit delay metrics.
ROI Trajectory: Line chart with real-time updates via Netlify functions.
Cost Savings: Bar chart comparing current vs. projected costs.

To fetch real-time ROI data:
// src/components/BusinessCase.jsx
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchRoiData = async () => {
    const response = await fetch(`${import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE}/fetch-roi`);
    const data = await response.json();
    setRoiData(data);
  };
  fetchRoiData();
  const interval = setInterval(fetchRoiData, 5000);
  return () => clearInterval(interval);
}, []);
